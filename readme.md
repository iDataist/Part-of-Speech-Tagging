# Part of Speech Tagging
I used the Pomegranate library to build a hidden Markov model for part of speech tagging with a universal tagset, and achieved >96% tag accuracy. Hidden Markov models have also been used for speech recognition and speech generation, machine translation, gene recognition for bioinformatics, and human gesture recognition for computer vision.
